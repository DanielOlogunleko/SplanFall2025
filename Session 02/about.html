        <h2>About Lingzhi</h2>
        <p>
            Lingzhi (Ganoderma sichuanense), also known as reishi, is a polypore fungus ("bracket fungus") native to East Asia belonging to the genus Ganoderma.
            Its reddish brown, varnished, kidney-shaped cap with bands and peripherally inserted stem give it a distinct fan-like appearance. When fresh, the lingzhi is soft, cork-like, and flat. It lacks gills on its underside, and instead releases its spores via fine pores (80–120 μm) in yellow colors.[2]
            In nature, it grows at the base and stumps of deciduous trees, especially maples. Only two or three out of 10,000 such trees will have lingzhi growth, and therefore its wild form is rare.[citation needed] Lingzhi may be cultivated on hardwood logs, sawdust, or woodchips.
            The lingzhi mushroom is used in traditional Chinese medicine.[2][4]

        <h3>Taxonomy</h3>
        <p>
            Lingzhi, also known as reishi from its Japanese pronunciation, is the ancient "mushroom of immortality", revered for over 2,000 years (with some evidence suggesting use in Neolithic China 6,800 years ago).[5] However, as of 2023 there is an ongoing debate on which one of the described Ganoderma species is the true lingzhi mushroom. It is also likely that a few similar Ganoderma species were considered interchangeable.
            In the scientific literature, the lingzhi mushroom is ambiguously referred to as:
            Ganoderma sichuanense — the currently accepted name, described by Zhao and Zhang (1983).[1]
            Ganoderma lingzhi — described by Cao et al. (2012)[2] as a novel species that may be the best fit for traditional definitions of the lingzhi mushroom. However, Du et al. (2023)[3] found that it is the same species as G. sichuanense, so it is now treated as a later synonym.
            Ganoderma lucidum — the type species of Ganoderma was first described in 1781 by Curtis as Boletus lucidus based on European collections. In 1881 Karst designated it as the type species of his new genus Ganoderma, as Ganoderma lucidum. Early literature used G. lucidum for collections from China, but it was later established that Asian populations are distinct from European, both morphologically and phylogenetically.[6][3] As the lingzhi fungus is strongly rooted in culture, the old name persists, even though it is well established that G. sichuanense and G. lucidum are distinct species.
            One source employed to solve the task of identifying the traditional lingzhi mushroom is the 16th century Chinese herbal compendium, the Bencao Gangmu (1578). There, a number of different lingzhi-like mushrooms defined by color were used for different purposes. No exact current species can be attached to these ancient lingzhi for certain, but according to Dai et al. (2017),[7] as well as other researchers, and based on molecular work, red lingzhi is most likely to be Ganoderma sichuanense.[8
